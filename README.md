# Emotion Recognition using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based facial emotion recognition system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It was developed as a final semester project for the BCA program.

## 🔍 Overview
- Detects human emotions from facial images
- Built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and Flask
- Trained on the FER-2013 dataset

## 🧠 Emotions Detected
- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprise
- Neutral

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- CNN (Keras/TensorFlow)
- OpenCV
- Flask (for web interface)

## 🗂️ Dataset
- [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
